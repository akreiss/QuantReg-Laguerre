Description: This package provides functions to compute semi-parametric estimates for the quantile of a distribution from censored data. This is achieved by means of sieve estimator: More precisely an approximation of the true conditional density is fit to the censored data. This includes an adjustment for heteroskedasticity. This estimator is computed using the function laguerre_estimator. In laguerre_cross_validation we also provide a method for cross-validation. The theoretical basis of the functions are given in Kreiss and Van Keilegom (2023).
